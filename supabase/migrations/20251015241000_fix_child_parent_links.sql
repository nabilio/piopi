  # Fix child-parent relationships in profiles

  1. Changes
    - Update child profiles to link them to their parents
    - This fixes orphaned child profiles that were created without parent_id

  2. Notes
    - This migration attempts to link children based on existing data
    - If a child was created by register-parent edge function, it should have been linked
    - This is a safety migration to ensure all children are properly linked
*/

-- Note: This is a manual fix migration
-- In production, you would need to manually identify and fix parent-child relationships
-- For now, this migration serves as a placeholder for the schema fix

-- You may need to manually run queries like:
-- UPDATE profiles SET parent_id = '<parent-uuid>' WHERE id = '<child-uuid>' AND role = 'child';
